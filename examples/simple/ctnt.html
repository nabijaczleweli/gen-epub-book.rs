&emsp;Due to the exhuberantly capitalist nature of this endeavour, I was extremely appaled by my assignment, as it didn't alight with my views at all.
Yet, a duty of a good agent is to ignore personal preferences and do what she is bidden, and I shall do that exactly.
And so, I took each individual degenerate's head and reached into it, just to see if he's influenced by my handler, if he listened to music;
and if he fed into that shit he was an innocent victim and became a puppet on the string of his tennis shoe.

&emsp;Then, I took seven kids from Columbine, stood them all in line, added an AK-47, a revolver, a nine, a MAC-11, and that solved the my handler's problem,
  a whole school of bullies shot up simultaneously.
